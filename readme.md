### ðŸŒŸ Overview

We propose a novel multimodal multi-head convolutional attention module for super-resolution. **MHCA** is a spatial-channel attention module that **can be integrated into any neural network at any layer**.
We are also the first to perform medical image superresolution using a multimodal low-resolution input.
